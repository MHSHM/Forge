Forge is a personal project that is a work in progress, it's not ready or functional, it's mainly a space to experiment with vulkan and how you can architect an RHI on top of it. It's aimed to be minimal and d3d11-like hiding all complex synchronization and memory management from the user while still providing a good performance.
